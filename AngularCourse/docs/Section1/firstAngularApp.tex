\chapter{First Angular App}
\section{Create a new angular project}
To create a new Angular project, we go into command line and type:

ng new name-of-project

By using this command, the Angular CLI creates folders and files and then uses npm to download third-party libraries.

We use Angular CLI to load our application into a server to test it. For that, we use the command:

ng serve when scoping the folder that contains the app.
