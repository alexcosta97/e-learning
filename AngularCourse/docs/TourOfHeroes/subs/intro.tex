\chapter{Introduction}
The $Tour of Heroes$ tutorial covers the fundamentals of
Angular. In this tutorial we will build an app that helps
a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes.

This basic app has many of the features we'd expect to find
a data-driven application. It acquires and displays a list
of heroes, edits a select hero's detail, and navigates
among different views of heroic data.

By the end of the tutorial we will be able to do the
following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide
    elements and display lists of hero data.
    \item Create Angular components to display hero details
    and show an array of heroes
    \item Use one-way data binding for read-only data
    \item Add editable fields to update a model with
    two-way data binding
    \item Bind component methods to user events, like
    keystrokes and clicks
    \item Enable users to select a hero from a master list
    and edit that hero in the details view
    \item Format data with pipes
    \item Create a shared service to assemble the heroes
    \item Use routing to navigate among different views and
    their components.
\end{itemize}
