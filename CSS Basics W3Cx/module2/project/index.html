      <p>Hey there<br/>
        My name is Alex Costa. In my spare time I go to university and code. Most of the time I am either working as a barista or learning new things.<br/>
        I enjoy playing the guitar and discovering new countries and cultures, and it kind of shows off when I say that I lived in 3 different countries in the past 5 years<br/>
        But that's just a little bit of me. Here is a list of my favourite things in the world!
