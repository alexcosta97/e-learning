\chapter{What is TypeScript?}
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that any JS code is also TS code, but TS has additional features that don't exist in the current version of JS currently supported, such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Strong typing
    \item Object-oriented features
    \item Compile-time errors
    \item Great tooling
\end{itemize}

The browsers don't understand TypeScript, so we need to transpile TS into JS.
