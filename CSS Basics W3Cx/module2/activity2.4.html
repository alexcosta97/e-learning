    <h1>Main Title</h1>
    <p>In unit 2.3, we defined CSS selectors as the portion of the CSS rule that
      tells the browser on which HTML element to apply the defined style. When
      our HTML is simple, the selectors can be simple as well. The most basic
      selectors simply mirror the HTML tag. For example, "p" attaches to all &lt;
      p&gt; tags, "img" will attach to all &lt;image&gt; tags and so on. As we
      can imagine, there will often be times when we don't want every single
      HTML element of a particular tag to have identical style.

    <h2>Sub Title 1</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How many of these HTML elements are on my page?</li>
      <li>Do I want this style to apply to every one of these elements</li>
      <li>What are this element's children?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sub Title 2</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>and do I want this style to apply to them as well?</li>
      <li>Is this element a block element or an inline element</li>
      <li>and does this style make sense in that context</li>
    </ol>
