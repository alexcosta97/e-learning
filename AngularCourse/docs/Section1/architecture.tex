    Modern applications nowadays have front-end and back-end. Front-end is the client side which includes the UI. It is usually made of HTML, CSS, TypeScript and Angular.

    The Back-end is situated in the servers and is usually responsible for doing all the work that evolves around data and processing.

    The front-end talks to the back-end to save and retrieve the data. In front-end, the data isn't often saved as it usually gets erased with a cache erasure. We often have one or more databases and many HTTP services and APIs to provide the data to the client.

    HTTP Services are end-points that are accessible through the HTTP protocol. These are used by HTTP requests by the client to get data and save data into the server.

    In complex applications, business logic is also implemented in the back-end. The front-end is all about the front-end, which contains the HTML templates and the presentation logic.

    With Angular, we will only worry with the front-end of the application, since it is what it is mostly used for.
