\chapter{Angular Version History}
\section{AngularJS}
It was introduced in 2010 as a JS framework for building client applications. It gained popularity and the developers started adding new features, but it was not design with the needs of today in mind.

\section{Angular 2}
Angular 2 came in in 2016 and is the result of the complete rewrite of the framework with TypeScript to address today's needs and to delete complexity. This version was completely different from Angular 1, so it made developers unhappy because it made them rewrite the entire applications they had built with Angular 1.

\section{Angular 4}
After a few minor upgrades, thorough minor version iterations (2.1, 2.2 and 2.3), Angular 4 was launched, causing confusion to a lot of developers. Angular 4 was not a major upgrade or an entire new framework.

Angular is composed of many different libraries, which were versioned differently (especially the router library). In order to avoid causing versioning conflicts and misunderstandings in the future, Angular jumped straight away into version 4 so that all the libraries had the same version at once.

In order to avoid stop the naming confusion, the version stopped being a part of the name of the framework and therefore now there are only two Angulars:

\begin{itemize}
    \item AngularJS (1.x)
    \item Angular (2+)
\end{itemize}
