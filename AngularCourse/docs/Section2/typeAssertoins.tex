\chapter{Type Assertions}
Sometimes, when the compiler doesn't know what the type of a variable is, it will automaticaly assume it is a variable of no type (any).

In order to fix that problem, type assertions need to be used in order to declare a variable to be of a certain type.

In order to do so, we add angular brackets to the variable to which we wish to declare the type. We also need to add parens around the variable and the angle brackets, so that the compiler knows that we want to assign the type for that particular variable.

Another way to assign a type to a variable is to declare (name as type), with the parens around it.
